# Multitask learning for discovering semantic relations between words

The repository contains the code used for Learning Lexical-Semantic Relations Using Intuitive
Cognitive Links. The code is provided in the form of notebooks.

## Code 
The code is available in the notebook `MultiTaskV0.0-c.ipynb`

Requirements: 
- Keras v. 2.1.5
- Tensforflow v. 1.4.5 

## Data
The data of the paper are on the `data` directory. The notebook also assumes access to the [GloVe embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/), in particular [these embeddings](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip).
